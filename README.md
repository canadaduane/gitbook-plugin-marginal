# Marginal

A gitbook plugin that creates a margin for notes. Used in conjunction with the `callouts` gitbook plugin.

## Installation

Add the following to your `book.json` configuration file:

```
{
	"plugins": ["marginal", "callouts"]
}
```

## Usage

Here is a callout:

```
> #### Quote::I, the writer, was born of Presbyterian parents...
> [The Rights of Christ, 1815, p. 1](https://archive.org/details/cihm_62453)
```

Your callouts should now be marginalized :)
